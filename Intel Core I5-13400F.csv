"Intel Core I5-13400F Processor 20M Cache, Up to 4.60 Ghz, LGA 1700"
"A fast processor for all school tasks such as PowerPoint Excel Canvas
With a 7800xt no bottleneck
It comes with better air cooling than previous generations and pre-applied thermal paste"
Does what he should the change from i5 3470 to 13400f is awesome good
This CPU is well priced and very fast for the price. Very happy customer indeed. Highly recommended!
"Even being the smallest i5, it does its job very well. Never a problem or a blockage despite having its stock heatsink. I use it for productivity and a few small games. counselled"
"Processor very powerful, calmly for years will handle. Transmission from Intel 5th generation to 13th:) The processor came in the OEM version, but the support gave me a discount to buy cooling, so I'm happy. Warranty is 2 years, so it's ok."
Very happy with the delivery and the product
"Many say that it heats up a lot but here it's a normal cool temperature, better cost-benefit Intel"
"It's a very good processor, I use it for crowds and it works great, I can play and record or transmit at the same time without reducing fps, the only thing wrong with the stock sink, it needs to be changed soon, at the beginning with the temperature it reached 100°C playing and recording, obviously not recommended, since with a tower sink the temperature is at most 50°C."
This processor is very fast. Perfect. Nothing to complain about.
"Get out of an i3 12400f for him and it made a big difference in the games, the only problem is the high temperature, but a good Air Cooler can do it"
"I knew there was two versions of the i5-13400f based on Alder and Raptor. But the Raptor was as rare as hens teeth in retail, supposedly kept for the OEM market and for slightly more power and without a boxed cooler. Well what did I get? The Raptor around 5% quicker than Alder, anything quicker in pc gaming is a plus. Lol"
"You can also recognize Stepping B0 (Raptor Lake) in a better catalog by the S-Spec code, which is SRMBG. It differs from Stepping C0 (Alder Lake, S-Spec code SRMBN) in the last letter of the designation – “G” instead of “N” Check the CPU die as per my picture. It also shipped with the Laminar RM1 cooler on my MSI MAG Tomahawk WIFI DDR5. Happy days! Check the net for more tech by inputting the two spec codes above. I’m playing Cyberpunk 2077 and an RTX 4060 TI at 1440P everything on ultra using Super DLSS and getting near 100FPS. Bearing in mind it’s both CPU and GPU intensive. Superb processor!"
"I'm trying it now that I'm writing this review, I find that it performs like its predecessor, the 12400f, with 100Mhz more that you can't even hear, perhaps with the slightly improved architecture it seems more responsive to me, but it's probably a feeling, given in hand we're there.
Like the 12400f, however, with 4 more Ecores that probably in a productive environment give that extra bit of calculation that doesn't hurt.
So 10 cores and 16 threads with a clock of 4Ghz in gaming is very good.
As always heavily armored, it's not unlocked, you can adjust only the RAM frequencies, the processor is that and that remains, in this Intel unfortunately it has always been very stingy, either take the K series or don't change a single comma.

Apart from this philosophical-commercial choice, this processor is a fairytale, with a 3070 everything works well for us and for that handful of watts it consumes it doesn't heat up much.
I bought it at a time on offer for 180€ and I believe that in the near future it will fall back to these figures, for a gaming PC, so to speak, “entry level” at that price it is a good deal."
Bought it as an upgrade from my last and it has been perfect so far.
Works well from the first time you use it.
Very fast CPU. My new PC runs faster than ever and without problems.
"Very good processor, the only problem is the temperature, you will need a more robust cooling system"
Very good as a processor
"Combined with a gtx 3060 ti video card, the highest resolution processor in games does not go beyond 40 percent. It seems strange but it responds perfectly to gaming.
There's no need to go on the i7 or i9. To play, the i5 13400 has always been advanced
by AMD. Today Intel. I think it's better. At least until now. In summer we'll see if and how much it heats up"
a good gaming cpu
Optimum price/performance ratio!
It is not the best value for money but the processor is still very good for running any game in 1440p ultra at 165 hz (for my case) I strongly recommend it because it is one of the best in the mid-range
"Very happy, I upgrade from an i5 9th gen 9600KF, night and day on some game !
Very chill in temp with my arctis freezer II 280mm, 40-50° in game"
Great article.
Would recommend this cpu to anyone it is so quick doesn't break a sweat !
Good processor for gaming and office
