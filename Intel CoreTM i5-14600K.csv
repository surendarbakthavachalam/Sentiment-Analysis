Intel CoreTM i5-14600K LGA 1700 Socket New Gaming Desktop Processor 14 (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked 
When compare to amd ryzen 7 7000 processors i5 14600k will easily beat in all aspects. But this will consume a lot of power and generate more heat. So we have to take atleast 700W with 80+ certified psu and a good liquid cooler. Any how As usually we can enjoy with this beast.
The seller posted the item but there was a delay from the postal service so they got the item back and posted the item with express delivery instead. Excellent and professional seller
Changed from 6700K
"to here it doesn't have a good reputation if it hasn't evolved much, but the performance is as expected"
Installation was great! It was my first time building a PC and nothing went wrong!
"Works just fine. Looking back you can get pretty similar performance on a 13th gen and save like $30, or go up to the I7 which gives you two more performance cores. It is working great though and cooler than the 14 gen I7 and I9."
Paired with a discounted Z690 board for gaming. New build posted and I updated the bios for this chip. No issues. Will update for experience of how it does with my 4070Ti Super.
"I got this CPU because I've been a long term Intel user and I have never had problems with them. This one replaced my i7 8700k and it is noticeably faster for my daily work (mostly Office, Internet content) and gaming (COD MW3). In terms of power consumption and heat generation, I can hardly notice it since all the workload I put on it hardly heats it up more than 45C-50C. I'm not a video/photo content creator nor a streamer, so this works for me. For example, while playing COD MW3 and Ultra settings the CPU use is about 2% while my GPU, RTX 3080, carries 98% of the bottleneck workload."
"You really don’t need anything over an i5 nowadays for gaming. I used to be an i7 or i9 guy, but there isn’t a need for them for gaming only. Runs cool on air or with an AIO."
"I bought this cpu to upgrade form the fx8350 I was running and I have to say paired with a rtx 2060 supper runs smooth at 4k 60fps with no problems what so ever, I would definitely recommend this cpu to anyone needing a upgrade form later gen cpus"
"Fast and working well,"
It runs a little hot in my ITX case but that's probably not the processors fault tbh
excelent product 100% recomended
"Coming from a ryzen 5 3500, this cpu is fast!"
Swapped out a12600k for the 14600k and it was a bigger jump in performance than I even expected
Works well paired with my 4070. Would recommend this chip
"I can stream and play anything without problems, I have no complaints, if you want to play, this is your processor, you don't need more cores for games."
"Did a bunch of research on the best CPUs to use for a gaming system and this one kept popping up as a great value. Reasonable price, works great."
Cost of this was great for how cores it has i like it also recommended.
"Excellent product, no problems with it at all, recommended"
