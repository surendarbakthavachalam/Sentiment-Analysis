Really good for budget builds
"I used this to build a pc for my wife. The performance on this CPU (depending on supporting hardware) matches or exceeds many CPUs available at both similar and higher price points. If you are truly going for a budget build, it is hard to beat this below $100."
Getting over 100fps and even 150fps in some cases with a 6600XT OC (while keeping VRAM usage under 6gb of course) on new games. This is a great CPU if you're on a budget
"This cpu is part of my upgrade from socket 1200 to socket 1700. This cpu is noticeably faster than the one it replaced, a 10th generation Intel i5. This cpu runs very cool and provides plenty of power for my everyday computing needs, which do not include gaming. My system currently runs the Zorin OS (Linux) smoothly and efficiently with temperatures sometimes under 30 degrees. Just remember that with this cpu you need a graphics card as the chip does not have that component. It is a nice touch that this cpu is compatible with either DDR4 or DDR5 memory. Just check the standards for the motherboard you intend to purchase. Best of luck with building your own desktop."
Its a damn good budget CPU. Great for 1080p -1440p gaming and everyday use with low power draw and heat output. No IGPU so you'll need a GPU of some kind in your build but that's about it
"I loved the i3-12100f because it is very cheap, but performs and likely wont bottleneck any of your GPUs (Unless your using a 4090 or sum). I saw fps numbers well above the hundred mark when playing many triple A titles, and it can go over 2 to even 3 hundred fps on esport titles. I paired it with a 6650xt"
Works like a charm. For all my Steam Games it works very well. Did some benchmarking and got very decent numbers. I used it with 16 MB DDR4 3200 MHz RAM and an RTX 2060 I had lying around. Used Valley and Supposition with VSYNC on for 1080P and had solid 60 FPS. VSYNC off got 80 to 100 FPS. CPU usage was never above 25 percent.
"My last I3 was the gen 9, so jumping to 12 and seeing that its a PINLESS CPU (pins are on the motherboard) was a big surprise and a bit of a relief. Overall I am damned happy with the upgrade, its not a top end gaming PC but its more than enough. I don't do competitive FPS games, RTX lighting is obnoxious as well as motion blur - basically purty graphics and good performance is what matters."
"Ya lo tengo desde hace un año y sin duda es el mejor procesador Calidad-Precio, aunque solo tenga 8 hilos y 4 núcleos, este los aprovecha al máximo haciendolo rendir mejor que i5 de generaciones pasadas y a varios de la serie 5000 de Ryzen y puede soportar hasta gráficas hechas para jugar a 1440p como la 3070ti o la 6700xt"
"Olha, a velocidade me surpreendeu! Pensei que o Clock seria baixo, mais ele faz o over sozinho, a frequência sobe para 4.3, e um ótimo processador pra quem quer trabalhar, ou jogar, vai funcionar para o dois! Se você tiver memória e um boa placa de vídeo."
"We only bought this to update BIOS on a new motherboard in order to use a newer CPU. This lil guy was a perfect solution to not further cripple our collective wallets, and we got the update run at long last! And now we have a spare CPU in case disaster strikes... again."
"Bought as a test CPU to see if motherboard was working, didn't use long, but seemed to be a good sub-$100 option."
"Performs as expected, but you do need a GPU for video output. Just spend the $30 for the iGPU (i-3 12100) version (works great as a Plex/Emby/Jellyfin/etc media server)."
works well for low end gaming pc if paired with a 6650 for me love it
for the money not bad for basic home computing starter CPU just wait and later buy an i9 14th gen CPU they kick asssss.
"all good, im using this pc now... for once the pc is working"
"If your on a price crunch i highly recommend this processor. It will eat just about any game, but dont expect 19 performance"
"Bought this for my modernity pack coming from an AMD hex-core. This little quad core slaps the FX series around in almost very manner, including lower power consumption. Pair this with a decent MoBo and RAM, and you have a great foundation. My only complaint, and it's small, but they don't include any thermal paste in the box, but meh."
Good enough to game with and under 100$
Great performance for the price. Cooler it comes with is great.
"Really great CPU, budget friendly. I recently build my pc and paired with rx 6600"
"This little friend can handle everything and more!!! Play virtual reality games AAA Battlefield games call of duty Microsoft flight simulator, photo and video editing."
"You don't need to buy the latest generation 14,900, this little friend consumes absolutely no electricity, and keeps your system stable so you can play and do your activities for hours without any problem."
good
Good if you doing light work or no serious gaming. I returned and went with a 5600x
"Normally I buy i7 processor machines, but I bought three of these for some basic gaming machines and they work great. Good benchmarks, no issues with gaming."
The price this little quad core comes in at really is incredible. Sure it's quad core but this is not the i3 of the past (well kinda is but you know what I mean). 4.3ghz single core with 8 threads means this think is a mini gaming beast. It can do 1440p gaming (with capable card of course) and I have been doing just that. The only reason I will be moving on from it is for the 6 core i3 in 14th gen. Best believe though I will be making another inexpensive PC with this when I upgrade. I have a spare 5500xt that should make for a quality 1080p second machine for when I visit home to my mom's. 5/5 stars.
"Amazing cpu for less then 100$. I put this into my build and it is VERY fast. I can play any game with no issues paired with Rx 6600. I would recommend upgrading to a better cpu in a year or 2 like a 12400F, but it isn’t necessary. If u are building a budget build then this is an awesome choice tho it will slowdown on you in a year or 2 so that’s why I’m gonna upgrade to 12400F soon"
Insane cpu for budget builds
"Lo mejor en calidad precio para gamer de entrada, rinde muy bien la verdad lo recomiendo"
Good processor for office and games
"This CPU comes with a cooler and a diagram showing how to attach said cooler. However the diagram showed use of a bracket on the motherboard and it did not have one in the box. Luckily I planned on using my own cooler anyways, however I can't overlook that as it would be frustrating to anyone relying on their box cooler to be ready to go"
"It came inside an Amazon bag, so the box bumped a little, as can be seen. Works great for gaming and office work as well, paired with a fast SSD and nice RAM sticks."
Works great
"I have this installed in an ASUS PRIME PLUS-D4 with an M.2 970 EVO Pro 1TB, ZOTAC 2080, 32GB VulcanC DDR4, AZZA Spectra 280 case with 7 fans. Running 1080P maxed out CyberPunk 2077 @ 57-60fps WHILE streaming was more than I thought this 'lil dude could handle. Third day stock cooler couldn't keep up so I threw in a Deepcool cooler in there! Never goes above 70C now.... Love this build :)"
"It is exactly what it shows and described on the promo. Works like a charm. I'm even surprised myself of how great is performing in my system. Comes with the whole shebang ready to install and also comes ready to install on the motherboard (Silver Thermal Grease CPU Heatsink Compound Paste). No need to put anything, just peel off the plastic and install... Awesome."
"It’s an intel processor, it’s gonna work, and it’s gonna work as expected. Good product, package was fairly banged up and the cpu is shipped visible at the top of the box standard from intel, I was lucky the cpu didn’t get damaged, cause the box sure did"
"If you look you will see this but I didn’t expect this processor to lack onboard graphics, just leaving this review so others know."
Plan on buying a separate cpu cooler because the one that was included is bad quality and easily broken so unless you are an incredibly careful person order a separate cpu cooler but the cpu is great value for the money
"I’d like to state that this isn’t a high end part. This is an $80 cpu with only 4 cores and 8threads but those are incredibly fast cores and pairing it with an appropriate gpu like the 3060, 6600(xt) and possibly up to the 3070, 6750xt, and 6800xt at 1440p or higher will run those gpus without an issue. Anything higher and you’d already be spending a lot for the rest of the system so just get a better cpu."
CPU is amazing for it's price. Decent performance compared to the predecessors. Pack it with RX 6600 and you will be happy playing your favourite games without hassle.
Works perfect ????
Perfecto
This is a great CPU to buy. It is good value. It also gives me high performance in gaming. It was also easy to set up. So far it has no problems.

Good cpu but the cooler was a pain to install.

Works perfect 
I was shocked by the incredible performance of this CPU. I love it. Incredible performance in a small package
"Beast for the money. Didn't quite work out with dlss frame gen and ms flight simulator, but slayed anything else."
Great product fast shipping

Lo compré porque creía que la nueva arquitectura y las nuevas tecnologías que traía la 12va generación de Intel serían muy diferente y más potente que las generaciones anteriores pero en mi caso solo hubo un rendimiento de alrededor de un 5% con este procesador.
"I recently upgraded to the newest entry level Intel i3 processor and I'm very impressed with its performance. It's perfect for everyday tasks like browsing the web, working on documents, and streaming videos. It's also surprisingly capable when it comes to more demanding tasks like photo and video editing. Overall, I think this processor is a great value for the price and I would definitely recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and affordable option."
Perfecto

"En la BIOS me ha costado configurar el procesador con algunas de sus funciones con respecto a velocidades, frecuencias y voltajes, pero funcionalmente está bien y con el disipador de stock no supera los 70°"
I recently bought a 12th gen MB for a high end oc and I needed a bios update before I can use my 13th gen. So I got this bc the mb don’t support flash bios but it served its 1 day use purpose and got returned for my 100$ back
Probably the best 100 dollar cpu out there.
"This CPU is very powerful for the cost. Great value. Very fast for the cost, but it does require you to have a dedicated graphics card."
Works perfect.

Awesome price and works flawlessly
Waiting for the graphics card. But it's working well with the Rx 5700 that is in there til then.
"Beast for the money. Didn't quite work out with dlss frame gen and ms flight simulator, but slayed anything else."
"Manages to work all my games such as Fortnite and such very well. Better than console and if matched properly to other components, you don’t need a very expensive build"
Best price to performance CPU in 2023
"Funcionando perfecto, por el precio no hay nada mejor"
"This CPU is very powerful for the cost. Great value. Very fast for the cost, but it does require you to have a dedicated graphics card."
"This CPU is really good for people who are looking to build a gaming PC on a budget. I am using it for my gaming PC, and its performance is really good for its price."
Never exceeded 125f with a cooler master fan cooler. Solid for budget gaming.
I saw the imprint of poorly whipped off thermal paste on my chip and if ur paying new prices for a used chip. What's the point.
Best price to performance CPU in 2023
Awesome price and works flawlessly
"For $100 you get yourself a 4-core processor with hyper-threading without turning your environment into an oven. The cooler included is able to handle the processor through gaming with no issues and may be able to do even heavier workloads. I have been using this CPU as entry-level into 12th/13th gen platforms. I have had no issues running many game titles, though should not expect top performance in triple A title games."
It's not much but will work for gaming
"his is the little giant of the CPUs, i3-12100/F right now is sufficient for 1080p gaming with a decent graphics card. Have been using it for almost a week now and it still feels unbelievable that this budget CPU is capable of the gaming I'm seeing in my PC."
"I've used the 12100F in several gaming builds and it is a great budget gaming CPU, in fact I wouldn't step up to a 12400F unless I was building a rig with a 6800/3080 level of GPU anything under that the 12100F will suffice. If your looking for production there might be better options though."
Awesome price and works flawlessly
"I have this in my plex server for transcoding. I try to only direct play, but cant always do it. This thing transcodes flawlessly. I am impressed"
This processor is the best value chip right now! Great for budget gamers! Will be capable for years to come in the mid-low end
If you are on a strict budget this is the chip to buy rn at $110
Great product fast shipping
I needed a cheap CPU that would work with my RX 6600 and this CPU saved me from going with the R5 5500 since I would've been paying more for an AMD build for less performance.
I like the price and this little cpu does a great job with the 3060 gpu. Play games great at 1080 and stays cool with the stock cooler that comes with it.
but it is a bottleneck in lots of games. but most games it will run fine some like Cyberpunk 2077 can jug because the cpu cores aren't enough
"muy bueno ,,excelente"
It's not much but will work for gaming
I use this with my rx5500 partnered by my noctua u12s redux CPU cooler. I run flight sim at about 60-68°c at around 60-80 fps. I just got into PC’s and I can tell that this was a really good CPU to start off with.
If you aren't planning on a GPU bigger than a 3070/6700 XT then go with this CPU. It is a beast for the price! I have built and sold 7 pc's with the 12100f and haven't had one single issue. Also the box cooler is great if it comes in without blades being broken. I had 3 come in like that.
This cpu is the best budget chip on the market imo yes the download speeds are amazing and the cooling isn’t the best at times but for price to performance this chip is worth every dollar would highly recommend this to anyone on a budget

"Great for cheaper builds because its a modern processor! The included fan works great and keeps the build cool, but I would opt for a better one (like a hyper 212 evo) later."
"This was a gift, built our own PC for the grandson, reliable and fast for his gaming needs, good value and like having the name brand."
Goooood
"Great processor! Just pay attention this model with the F in the end do not work with integrated video, so you will always need an external graphic card to work."
Fully working and blazing fast for 100$
works very well
This CPU is the best in terms of value. Doesn't cost much and punches high above its weight.
So far so good

"Maybe this isn’t the best cpu out there but for the price, it’s great value. Works pretty good for gaming and doesn’t cost too much for a cpu."
"This cpu is perfect for 1080p gaming, mid to high settings. Pairs well with the rtx 3050 or rx 6600"
I use it to test and upgrade older motherboards or defective rigs.
Perfect for low budget gaming!!! I built my 1st PC with it!
Extremely powerful
