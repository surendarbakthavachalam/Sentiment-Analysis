This is From Team Innovative Titans submitted our project in the topic Intel products Sentiment analysis from online reviews conducted by Intel Unnati Industrial Program We have attached our code which we built to give an efficient way of output attached in Sentiment analysis.py file We have also gave the files which has the reviews as a dataset individually for every new processors launched by Intel #Watch the Video attached as Video - Sentiment analysis which has a demonstration of how the code works and gives output

We have initially downloaded the required libraries such as nltk from that we have extracted the stompwords and vader which is used to extract the unwanted words from the dataset which we've provided

We extracted dataset from e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, Bestbuy, Alibaba manually which been as a Time taking process we can also use web scrapping methods in python

We used python as our code working platform beacause of the efficiency and the no of libraries available in the python which is been useful for us to use We got an output as that most of the reviews has neutral analysis ie we had came to know that all the Intel products which we reviewed has both the positive and negative reviews which gave us an neutral output

We are planning to extract the reviews separately for each and every dataset as positive values and negative values in future also it will be helpful to view the exact analysis of the reviews given by the users on the product
